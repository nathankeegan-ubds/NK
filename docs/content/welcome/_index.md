AMBA supports three types of activity alerts to monitor your Azure resources. These alerts help you stay informed about the status and health of your Azure services:

- **Alerts for logs and metrics**: These keep track of your system's logs and performance metrics.

- **Alerts with static thresholds**: These trigger when certain predefined limits are reached.

- **Alerts with dynamic thresholds**: These adapt based on patterns and trends in your data.
