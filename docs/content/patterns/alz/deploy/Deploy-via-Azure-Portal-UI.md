## Deployment Settings Blade

![Deployment Settings Blade](../../media/PortalAccelerator/DeploymentSettings.png)

- Change the values on the Deployment Settings blade to the instructions below:
  - Choose the Management Group where you wish to deploy the policies and the initiatives. This is usually the so called "pseudo root management group", for example, in [ALZ terminology](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/landing-zone/design-area/resource-org-management-groups), this would be the so called "Intermediate Root Management Group" (directly beneath the "Tenant Root Group").
  - Choose the value of _`Region`_ to specify your Azure location of choice.
  - Change the value of _`Resource group for baseline alerts`_ to the name of the resource group where the activity logs, resource health alerts, actions groups and alert processing rules will be deployed in.
  - Choose the value of _`Resource group location`_ to specify the location for said resource group.
  - Choose the value of _`Bring Your Own User Assigned Managed Identity`_ to specify if you want to bring your own user assigned managed identity for monitoring purpose.
  - Define the value of _`User Assigned Managed Identity Name`_ to specify the name of the user assigned managed identity for monitoring purpose.
  - Choose the value of _`Bring Your Own User Assigned Managed Identity Resource Id`_ to specify the resource id of the user assigned managed identity if you want to bring your own user assigned managed identity for monitoring purpose.
  - Choose the value of _`Management Subscription Id`_ to specify the subscription id where the user assigned managed identity will be created.
  - Choose the value of _`Customer Usage Selection Option`_ Microsoft can identify the deployments of the Azure Resource Manager and Bicep templates with the deployed Azure resources. Microsoft can correlate these resources used to support the deployments. Microsoft collects this information to provide the best experiences with their products and to operate their business. The telemetry is collected through customer usage attribution. The data is collected and governed by Microsoftâ€™s privacy policies, located at the trust center.
  - Change the value of _`Resource Group Tags`_ to specify the tags to be added to said resource group.

## Notification Settings Blade

![Notification Settings Blade](../../media/PortalAccelerator/NotificationSettings.png)

{{< hint type=note >}}
While it's technically possible to not add any notification information (no email, no ARM Role, no Logic App, etc.) it is strongly recommended to configure at least one option.
{{< /hint >}}

- Change values on the Notification Settings Blade blade to the instructions below:

  - Change the value of _`Bring Your Own Notifications (BYON)`_ to _` Yes`_ if you wish to use existing Action Groups and Alert Processing Rule. The BYON feature works by setting the necessary parameter values before running the ALZ pattern deployment. Customers have the choice to either specify one or more existing AGs and one APR or to enter target values so the AG and the APR will be created using the actions specified in the parameter file (including the option to not specify any value and creating an empty AG).
  - Change the value of _`Email contact for action group notifications`_ to the email address(es) where notifications of the alerts (including Service Health alerts) are sent to. Leave the value blank if no email notification is used.
  - Change the value of _`Webhook Service Uri`_ to the URI(s) to be used as action for the alerts (including Service Health alerts). Leave the value blank if no Webhook is used.
  - Choose the value of _`Arm Role Id`_ to the Azure Resource Manager Role(s) where notifications of the alerts (including Service Health alerts) are sent to. Leave the value blank if no Azure Resource Manager Role notification is required.
  - Change the value of _`Logicapp Resource Id`_ to the Logic app resource id to be used as action for the alerts (including Service Health alerts). Leave the value blank if no Logic app is used.
  - Change the value of _`Logicapp Callback Url`_ to the Logic app callback url of the Logic app you want to use as action for the alerts (including Service Health alerts). Leave the value blank if no Logic app is used. To retrieve the callback url you can either use the [_**Get-AzLogicAppTriggerCallbackUrl**_](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.logicapp/get-azlogicapptriggercallbackurl) PowerShell command or navigate to the Logic app in the Azure portal, go to _**Logic app designer**_, expand the trigger activity (_When an HTTP request is received_) and copy the value in the URL field using the 2-sheets icon.

  - Change the value of _`Event Hub Resource Id`_ to the Event Hubs to be used as action for the alerts (including Service Health alerts). Leave the value blank if no Event Hubs is used.
  - Change the value of _`Function Resource Id`_ to the Function resource id to be used as action for the alerts (including Service Health alerts). Leave the value blank if no Function is used.
  - Change the value of _`Function Trigger Url`_ to the Function App trigger url of the function to be used as action for the alerts (including Service Health alerts). Leave the value blank if no Function is used. To retrieve the Function App trigger url with the corresponding code, navigate to the HTTP-triggered functions in the Azure portal, go to _**Code + Test**_, select **Get function URL** from the menu top menu and copy the value in the URL field using the 2-sheets icon.

    ![Get function URL](../../media/AMBA-FunctionAppTriggerUrl.png)

  {{< hint type=note >}}
  It is possible use multiple email addresses, as well as multiple Arm Roles, Webhooks or Event Hubs (not recommended as per ALZ guidance). Should you set multiple entries, make sure they are entered as an array. Example:

  `["action1@contoso.com","action2@contoso.com","action3@contoso.com"]`

  `["https://webhookUri1.webhook.com","http://webhookUri2.webhook.com"]`
